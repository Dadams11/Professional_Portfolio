# Advanced-CSS-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio
My motivation for creating my portfolio was to develop an easy to use web application that effectively showcases my potential and commitment to excellence. I aim to demonstrate my prior achievements, while highlighting the newly acquired skills gained from the Boot Camp.

My ultimate goal for taking this course and working on this project is to enhance my understanding of web design and application development, allowing me to apply the skills to real world projects with a professional approach.

-  I will continue updating this portfolio until I have completed this bootcamp and have created a project that I am proud of and can showcase to future employers for new opportunities.
